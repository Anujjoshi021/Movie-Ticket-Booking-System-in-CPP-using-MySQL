Usage:
Compile and run the program.
Connect to the MySQL database by setting credentials in the code.
Use the console menu to reserve seats or exit.
The seating layout updates dynamically based on reservations.
This project demonstrates a practical C++ application, emphasizing database interaction, OOP design, and user experience.
